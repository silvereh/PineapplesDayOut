				<p>The Museum will be opened to all members of the community to visit anytime. What makes the museum special is that it will be filled with artwork that is on the Ethereum blockchain. All artwork will be bought by the moderators through direct purchases, placing bids via auction and making offers.</p>
				<p>95% of the artwork bought for the museum would have been created by verified pineapple holders and the remaining 5% would have been created by non-verified pineapple holders.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12 col-md">
				<p>The Cocktail bar is an exclusive bar for only the holders of both pineapples and coconuts. There will be weekly game nights hosted by the Moderators.</p>
				<p>These include Trivia, Poker, Riddles and then Giveaways. There will be prizes of other NFTs or even Ethereum.</p>
