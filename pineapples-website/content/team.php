						<div class="team-description">
							Laura is a small 23 year-old Ugandan female who enjoys watching sports and playing video games. She graduated in May with a Bachelors Degree in Commerce, majoring in Accounting. She has been active in the NFT community since late March 2021. She was able to identify the general under-representation of Africans in NFTs. She has been trying to (and will continue to) bring them on board in any way that she can, using <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AFR_ToTheWorld">@AFR_ToTheWorld</a>. She believes everyone needs to have a chance to create a future for themselves.

						<p>Lead Artist / Co-Founder</p>
						<div class="team-description">
							Natasha is a woman and an artist. If she had to describe herself in three words, she would fail because there’s only one definition for her, and that’s art. She recently joined the NFT community in late march 2021 and there’s nothing better than having a community that appreciates art in all its glory. She hopes to make her name known and respected in the community. She also loves pineapple juice and dark chocolate.

						<p>Developer</p>
						<div class="team-description">
							Silvere is a 34 year-old French expatriate living currently in Idaho with his wife and his two kids. He has been observing the NFT space since March 2021 and decided to learn blockchain and smart contract development in May. Since then, he was able to quickly learn enough to be able to deploy his first smart contract in the first half of July, before joining the Pineapples team as sole developer. He spends most of his free time helping out others on Discord developer circles.

						<p>Community Manager</p>
						<div class="team-description">
							Sydney is a Ugandan from a family of 4; a law student currently studying in Uganda Christian University (UCU), but his education has been disrupted by the pandemic as the government placed lockdown restrictions in 2020 as a way to prevent the spread of COVID. Even though he has not been able to study and complete his classes as smoothly as he would have hoped, he would love to incorporate law with technology such as NFTs. Pineapples Day Out is his first NFT project.
